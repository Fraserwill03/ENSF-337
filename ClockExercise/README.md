# Clock Object Exercise

## Overview:
This program was written for an assignment that focused on the creation of a basic class in C++. It required the creation of an object that acts as a clock.
I wrote all code for the class in lab7clock.cpp and lab7clock.h, however the file lab7ExC.cpp was provided by the course for testing the Clock class.
